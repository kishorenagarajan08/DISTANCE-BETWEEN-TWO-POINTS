# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the values from the user
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of variable to a temporary variable
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Using the slicing concept rotate the list
### Step 5: 
Print both the values it would be interchanged

Step 6:
### PROGRAM:
```
import math
list1=[4,2]
list2=[10,6]
d=math.sqrt((list2[0]-list1[0])**2+(list2[1]-list1[1])**2)
print(f"{d:.2f}")
```

  


### OUTPUT:
